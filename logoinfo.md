The HORUS Logo was designed and created by **Michelle David**,  Communications Manager for the Institute for Cyber-Enabled Research (ICER) at Michigan State University.

The logo is a combination of the Egyptian word Horus and the theme of helping researchers. The triangle represents an Egyptian pyramid while also representing the joining of the three entities behind HORUS. Having the letter R as the largest letter at the peak of the triangle symbolizes the most important part of the HORUS project - the researchers. Finally, the yellow and blue shapes reflect a simplified image of the Egyptian god Horus. Horus was said to be the Egyptian god of the sky whose right eye was the sun.
